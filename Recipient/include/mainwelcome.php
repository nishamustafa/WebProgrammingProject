              A survey conducted by United Nations agencies UNICEF and
              UNFPA in the near end of 2020, when Malaysia underwent the conditional movement control order (CMCO), it is found that
              the socio-economic state of an approximate half of the Malaysian
              households were gradually deteriorating due to them nearing their
              breaking points. These surveys have found that unemployment in
              the country has doubled up to 15% when compared to three months
              prior the occurence, where one-third of a household remains
              unemployed. <br/><br/>

              Due to the current state of unemployment and loss of jobs of the
              public since COVID-19 occured, Donate4All takes the advantage
              to help the families and those who are in need in a rough time.

              a platform for those who requires aid to afford basic necessities.
